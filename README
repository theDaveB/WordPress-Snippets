This is my first Repo (hope am doing it right).

All code in here is written in PHP and is used in WordPress installations.

For the code to work I usually install the Shortcode Exec PHP plugin by Marcel Bokhorst.

I will add descriptions here for each file as I add it.

CustomPost.php - Creates custom posts from a XML file and inserts associated image files to that post.
VoucherCodes.php - Reads in a XML file from the Buyat network and displays the latest voucher codes.
VoucherCodesCSV.php - Reads in a CSV file from Affiliate Window and displays the latest voucher codes.
MediFusion.php - Pass it a ASIN and will display details about it and a price comparison table.
